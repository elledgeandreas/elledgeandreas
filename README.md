- Hi, Iâ€™m @elledgeandreas!
- I hold a Master in Finance & Strategy from Sciences Po Paris and two Bachelors in Economy from Keio University Tokyo and Sciences Po Paris.
- I now work for a crypto asset investment firm. 
- I've been learning data analysis, data science and blockchain development while trading cryptocurrencies for the past 4 years.
- My goal is to present simple data projects so that anyone can learn to code from scratch: from zero to dev.
- Let's learn the basis of Python, data analysis, blockchain and more.
- My projects are taken from many learning programs and I will make a selection of the most relevant ones
